          <p>Your privacy is important, so RIPEN (“RIPEN LLC.”, “Us,” “We,” “Our”) has created the&nbsp;following Privacy Policy so our customers (“customers,” “you,” “yours,” “they”) know what information&nbsp;we collect when they visit and use our website (“Site”), why we collect it and how it is used. This privacy&nbsp;policy (the “Policy”) discloses Furtive’s information privacy practices for the Site and the services&nbsp;we provide to our customers (“Services”).We may periodically make changes to this Policy and those changes become effective immediately upon&nbsp;posting them to the Site. It is your responsibility to review this Policy frequently and remain informed&nbsp;about any changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often. &nbsp;We are not required to provide&nbsp;notice of changes to this Policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Information Collected</strong></p>
        <p>When you use our Site or Services, RIPEN may collect from you the following personally&nbsp;identifiable information: <strong>[first and last name, street and/or mailing address, city, state and zip code,&nbsp;email address, and phone number]</strong>. &nbsp;We are the sole owner of information collected on the Site, except&nbsp;for contact lists and content that you provide to us in connection with your use of our products and&nbsp;services (including but not limited to your logo or office locations). &nbsp;Furtive also automatically&nbsp;receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, type&nbsp;of browser, cookie information and the page you request. You can choose not to provide us with certain&nbsp;information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.</p>
        <p>We only collect and use personally identifiable information regarding users of the Site or Services as&nbsp;described in this Policy. In addition, we do not process or use personally identifiable information that we&nbsp;collect or that is received from our customers or from other third parties in a way that is incompatible&nbsp;with the purposes for which it was collected or received or subsequently authorized by you. Except as&nbsp;noted in this Policy, personally identifiable information collected by Furtive on the Site or&nbsp;through the Services is NOT shared with third parties without your consent.</p>
        <p>Furtive may keep a cached copy of the content you provide or disclose to us as a part of your use&nbsp;of the service for an indeterminate or indefinite period of time, including media files. To assist in&nbsp;development, we may keep copies of HTTP requests and responses in ur notification log. If your web&nbsp;server does not specify that we can cache your content, we will not keep a cached copy of any text or&nbsp;audio data transmitted through our service during calls, but we may still maintain copies in your&nbsp;notification log. &nbsp;We may also keep call log, notification log, billing/ payment, and other log data as we&nbsp;determine is appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>How Is Such Information Used?</strong></p>
        <p>Furtive uses the personally identifiable and other collected information to provide the Services&nbsp;and to allow you to access and use the Site, all in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. If you&nbsp;provide personally identifiable information for a certain reason, we may use the personally identifiable&nbsp;information in connection with the reason for which it was provided and for any other reason consistent&nbsp;with the terms of this Policy. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we will use the personally&nbsp;identifiable information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you&nbsp;provide personally identifiable information in order to obtain access to the Furtive Site or&nbsp;Services, we will use such information to provide you with access to such Services and to monitor your&nbsp;use of such Services. Your personally identifiable information may be used to provide you with product&nbsp;information and support services offered on the Site, to notify you of technical updates or changes in&nbsp;policy, to improve the content and functionality of the Furtive Site and Services, to help us better&nbsp;understand our users, or to deliver or offer other Services.</p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;The Information Shared or Disclosed with Third Parties</strong></p>
        <p>Furtive is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a&nbsp;vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share&nbsp;your personally identifiable information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set&nbsp;forth below:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Employers and Recruiters: &nbsp;we may share your personally identifiable information with potential&nbsp;employers and recruiters in connection with placing or attempting to place you with an&nbsp;employer.</li>
        <li>Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the&nbsp;event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personally&nbsp;identifiable information may be part of the transferred assets. You acknowledge that such&nbsp;transfers may occur, and that any acquirer or successor of Furtive may continue to use&nbsp;your information as set forth in this Policy.</li>
        <li>Agents, Consultants, Third Party Service Providers, and Related Third Parties: Furtive, like&nbsp;many businesses, sometimes uses other companies to perform certain business-related&nbsp;functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases,&nbsp;developing new services, enhancing current services, and processing payments. When we&nbsp;employ another company or individual to perform a function of this nature, we only provide&nbsp;them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. &nbsp;In addition, we&nbsp;may provide job searching services such as job boards, search functions and the ability to&nbsp;inquire, apply for and otherwise interact with recruiters and employers. &nbsp;These services may be&nbsp;provided by third parties and not by Furtive. &nbsp;In the event you chose to utilize these&nbsp;services you may be asked to share personally identifiable information with us and those third&nbsp;party service providers.</li>
        <li>Legal Requirements and Other Circumstances: Furtive may disclose your personally&nbsp;identifiable information if required to do so by law, subpoena, court order or in the good faith&nbsp;belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend&nbsp;the rights or property of Furtive, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal&nbsp;safety of users of the Furtive Site or Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal&nbsp;liability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The Security of Information</strong></p>
        <p>We will take reasonable precautions to protect personally identifiable information in our possession&nbsp;from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We follow generally&nbsp;accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both&nbsp;during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of&nbsp;electronic storage is, however, 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable&nbsp;means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        <p><strong>Children</strong></p>
        <p>Furtive is not intended for or directed to persons under the age of 18. Any person who provides&nbsp;their information to Furtive represents to us that they are 18 years of age or older.</p>
        <p><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong></p>
        <p>We use a variety of technologies on our Site. Among these are cookies: a text-only string of information&nbsp;that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer so that the website can&nbsp;remember your browser in the future. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from&nbsp;which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a unique number. When&nbsp;you visit our Site, open our email, encounter our services online (including on one of our customer's&nbsp;websites), or click on one of our banner ads or videos, we or an authorized third party may send you a&nbsp;cookie.</p>
        <p>Cookies may be used by us in many ways: they allow us to verify the login status of customers using&nbsp;products or services linked directly with our Site, track point of entry to point of registration for those&nbsp;users participating in our affiliate signup programs, track and measure the success of a particular&nbsp;marketing campaign, provide you with improved customer service and provide you with more relevant&nbsp;content. Cookies also allow us to track overall site usage and determine areas users prefer, as well as&nbsp;enable us to make your visit to our Site easier by recognizing you when you return and help to provide&nbsp;you with a customized experience.</p>
        <p>Information gathered through usage of a cookie is not linked to any personal identifying information,&nbsp;unless you become a trial or paying customer. Once you submit personally identifiable information on&nbsp;our Site (for example, by signing up to be a trial or paying customer or by signing up for a seminar or&nbsp;white paper), we may link such information with cookies or other identifiers that are associated with&nbsp;your visit(s) to our Site. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in&nbsp;your browser. If you choose to disable cookies, you may still use our Site; however, you may have&nbsp;limited access to some areas within our Site or a different experience. For more information on how to&nbsp;manage cookies in your web browser, see <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org">http://www.aboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
        <p>Some of our web pages, emails, and other online content may contain electronic images provided by us&nbsp;or authorized third parties known as web beacons, also known as single-pixel GIFs, which are invisible&nbsp;graphical images. These web beacons allow us to count users who have visited our Site, seen our ads, or&nbsp;opened our email, and to track whether messages are shared using our social share features and, once&nbsp;shared, whether these messages are opened by the recipient. In addition, when you click on a link in an&nbsp;email, we record this individual response to allow us to customize our offerings to you. Web beacons&nbsp;collect only limited information, such as a cookie identifier, time and date of a page being viewed, and a&nbsp;description of the page on which the web beacon resides. Web beacons cannot be declined when&nbsp;delivered using a regular web page, but they can be refused when delivered by email. If you do not wish&nbsp;to receive web beacons by email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select text only)&nbsp;emails via your email software.</p>
        <p>We may share non-personally identifying information with third parties, such as the media, industry&nbsp;observers or potential customers or partners.</p>
        <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
        <p>This Site may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that&nbsp;Furtive is not responsible for the privacy policies of such other sites. We encourage you to be&nbsp;aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that&nbsp;collects personally identifiable information. This Policy applies only to information collected by this Site.</p>
        <p><strong>Consent to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>

We encourage you to periodically review this Policy to stay informed about how&nbsp;we are protecting the personally identifiable information we collect. Your continued use of this Site or&nbsp;Furtive’s Services constitutes your agreement to this Policy and any updates.</p>
        <p><strong>Notification of Changes&nbsp;</strong></p>

If wedecide to change this privacy statement in any material way, we will notify you here, by means of a&nbsp;notice on www.ripen.ga so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how&nbsp;we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
